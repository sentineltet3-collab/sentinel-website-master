            <p>
                The company was founded by Col. Jose P. Rueda, a decorated military officer and former Security Director of San Miguel Corporation.
                A top graduate of the Philippine Constabulary Academy in 1924, Col. Rueda served in World War II, notably as part of the security escort
                to Gen. Douglas MacArthur in Leyte in 1942.
            </p>
            <p>
                His dedication to service extended beyond the battlefield—supporting Malacañang Palace, foreign dignitaries, and multinational investors.
                In 1968, Sentinel Watchman and Protective Agency was officially entrusted to his leadership.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now in its third and fourth generation of leadership, the Manotok family continues to uphold Col. Rueda’s founding values: service, honor,
                and the dignity of security professionals.
